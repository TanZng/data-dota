#Introduction

Python script to collect dota 2 data.

#How to run

1. Execute "collectDotaData - MatchIDs" to get some match IDs from the main API
2. Execute "CollectDotaData - MatchDetails" to download the match details from the OpenDota API

#Notes:
1. The scripts were made to run on a local computer, so some changes must be made before integration into Airflow Container
2. A "first match" must be present in the /data/matches file, as the script does not know a match sequence number to start collecting from
